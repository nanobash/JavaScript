### ECMAScript 6 && Functional Programming

***

**Functional Programming**:<br>

> Is a **paradigm** in which functions are going to work out its logic by **depending only its input**.

**Paradigm Features**:

* Referential Transparency Concept
* Imperative (**How** things should be done)
* Declarative (**What** should be done)
* Abstraction (**How** part is abstracted in a Higher-Order functions and concentrate is made on **what** part)

**Paradigm Benefits**:

1. Pure Functions (Always returns the same output for the same given input)
2. Testable Code
3. Reasonable Code
4. Parallel Coding (Nonetheless that JavaScript uses only one thread, pure function does not change anything outside
the function scope, any of its environment)
5. Caching (Pure functions result can be cached, since the output will be always the same for the same input. Caching
increases performance)
6. Pipelines and Composability
